|            | 10. Logout should be easy without going through many steps                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 10/10/2018 | 1) An application must be lightweight. So using an image and storing it might slow the application.                                                                                                                                                                        |
|            | 2) Think about the impact on performance if we store the images.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|            | 3) Talk with a mentor, whether to add images/icons or not. It also may be expensive w.r.t space.                                                                                                                                                                           |
|            | 4) If using images/icons, it must fit and look perfectly (responsive) in mobile screen.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|            | 5) In mobile screen, Instructor is not able to view more than one courses in a single page.                                                                                                                                                                                |
|            | 6) Current design looks good on a large screen and bad on the small screen                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|            | 7) Images/icons are not important things, crucial things are that instructors should be able to view Name and Course and Percentage of students retrieved the code.                                                                                                        |
|            | 8) Start date is not required for the course.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|            | 9) End date, of course, is not required if the courses would be displayed in an order.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|            | 10) CRN needs to be removed(Not part of the specification)                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|            | 11) A section should be unique with the semester.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|            | 12) There should be a unique identifier for Instructor. He/she should be able to view Course Name, Semester and Instructor’s identifier(Identifier should be randomly generated)                                                                                           |
|            | 13) There should be some default data which can be changed later like start date can be filled with today’s date (system date) and Instructor can change the data later on.                                                                                                |
|            | 14) Instructor’s Name is required while creating add course in course details.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|            | 15) There must be two survey URL, pre and post. Currently, there is only one URL which should not be a default and should not force Instructor to use that URL only(Instructor should have access to change the URL)                                                       |
|            | 16) Start and End date should be viewed by both Instructor and Students but after the end date, Instructor should still be able to view the dates which students cannot see after the end date.                                                                            |
|            | 17) There should be some kind of checkbox to indicate show courses that are expired.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|            | 18) The view should look OK in both portraits as well as in landscape mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|            | 19) Each code-word must be different from one another by at least 2 letters and they should not be like the same.                                                                                                                                                          |
|            | 20) Code-words should be of 4-5 letters at least.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|            | 21) An instructor should be able to know the matrix used to select the code-words.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|            | 22) Instead of a CLOSE button, there should be a CANCEL button. It should be CANCEL and CREATE.                                                                                                                                                                            |
|            | 23) There should be only one way of canceling the model. There is no need of (X) at the top right corner to cancel the model ( Talk to mentor regarding this)                                                                                                              |
