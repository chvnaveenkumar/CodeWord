-	What each person must discusses
-	Show the front view as if you were looking straight at it
-	Cavalier oblique drawings cause the sides and top to look deeper than they are.
-	each slide feels like part of the same story. That means using the same or related typography
-	One thing to avoid slides with a considerable measure of content, particularly if it's a rehash of what you're stating so anyone can hear.
-	 It resembles if you give a paper freebee in a gathering—everybody's head goes down and they read, instead of staying heads-up and tuning        in.
-	 If there is a considerable measure of words on your slide, you're requesting that your group of onlookers split their consideration between what they're perusing and what they're hearing. That is extremely difficult for a mind to do, and it bargains the viability of both your slide content and your talked words. 
-	If you can't abstain from having content y slides, endeavor to continuously uncover content as you require it.
- utilizing straightforward, punchy photographs in introductions, since they help what you're stating resound in your crowd's psyche without pulling their consideration from your talked words.
